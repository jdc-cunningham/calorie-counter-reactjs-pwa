So I've become pretty unpleasantly thicc with this pandemic. I used to hit up the gym on avg 5 days a week. [This was 2-3 years ago](https://i.imgur.com/9ltGrAZ.png) I was working a job standing up, working out insane like sometimes 3 hours straight. I wasn't ripped but I had some definition. I also didn't have a car/was roller blading home 5 miles. I think the lowest I had weighed at this time was between 205-215 lbs. Right now I'm 253lbs lmao... CHONK. It's all irrelevant in the end as not really social anymore... still I'd rather look good than bad.

Ahh... man I feel spent mentally though. I have been in a rut like over the weekend/Thanksgiving break. I had one day of productivity, rest of it I just felt like doing nothing/binge ate... (that's what why I'm so thicc)

I did have a feature thought, I'll log my daily weight as well. Eventually should see a relationship between the calories against baseline and weight drop over time. The calorie counter does have the ability to subtract for exercise but as mentioned I mostly live in a box.

So... my old piece of crap code was too annoying to fix.
Also I am not exactly a goshujinsama in async stuff... ahh 2 hours gone.
Easier to start from scratch than relearning the hectic state management and poor architecture I built 17 months ago.
I did like the base interface design/color palette so I will try to salvage that.

I'm going to work on the clu project real quick though, the plotting where I just assumed it would work as is did not.
Also the term is "visual inertial semantic representation" that's OP, pathetic what I'm trying to do compared to that.
