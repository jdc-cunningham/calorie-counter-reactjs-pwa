### Yeah...

So... my old piece of crap code was too annoying to fix.
Also I am not exactly a goshujinsama in async stuff... ahh 2 hours gone.
Easier to start from scratch than relearning the hectic state management and poor architecture I built 17 months ago.
I did like the base interface design/color palette so I will try to salvage that.

I'm going to work on the clu project real quick though, the plotting where I just assumed it would work as is did not.
Also the term is "visual inertial semantic representation" that's OP, pathetic what I'm trying to do compared to that.
